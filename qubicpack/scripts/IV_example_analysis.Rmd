I-V analysis example
===========

```{python}
# directories

# this is the location of data on CC-IN2P3
top_dir = '/sps/qubic/Data/Calib-TD'
```

```{python}
# Change this to the dataset you wish to analyze
dataset0 = top_dir+'/2020-01-06/2020-01-06_14.56.50__V-I 350mK'
```

```{python}
# imports
import os,sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from qubicpack.qubicfp import qubicfp
```

```{python}
# create the qubicpack focal plane object and read the data
d0=qubicfp()

# the first data file contains measurements at high temperature
# these are used to correct the Normal Resistance
d0.read_qubicstudio_dataset(dataset0)

```

```{python}
# first of all, have a look at all timelines for all the TES
res = d0.plot_timeline_focalplane()
```

```{python}
# now look at one in particular.
res = d0.plot_timeline(TES=85,asic=1)
```

```{python}
# and let's plot the I-V curve for that TES
fig = d0.plot_iv(TES=85,asic=1)
```

```{python}
# We run the filter which fits a model to each TES I-V curve
# This will take a few minutes
f = d0.filter_iv_all()
```

```{python}
# now plot all the I-V curves
res = d0.plot_iv_focalplane()
```

```{python}
# We can make a report giving all the I-V curves at 350mK
# this will take a few minutes to run as it will produce all the necessary plots
# it will ultimately produce a PDF file for each ASIC (two PDF files)
# you can find them in the directory: ./2020/20200106
texfile = d0.make_iv_report()
```

```{python}

```
