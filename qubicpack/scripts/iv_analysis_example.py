This is an example script for analysing the QUBIC I-V measurement
You can run this in ipython, or Jupyter notebook.
'''


'''
Before beginning, you should have pystudio installed, and copy the example data files.

You will also need my datefunctions module

### INSTALLATION OF qubicpack ###

get the package from github

$ git clone https://github.com/satorchi/qubicpack
$ cd qubicpack
$ sudo python ./setup.py install

$ cd ../
$ git clone https://github.com/satorchi/mypy.git
$ cd mypy
$ sudo python ./setup.py install

### Data files ###
Download appropriate data files.  These should be I-V measurements.

Please see the QUBIC wiki for instructions:
